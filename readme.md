American Sign Language to Text.

This projects take image dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/ayuraj/asl-dataset

We preprocessed the data for reducing the computantional power and then trained a CNN model for getting the real time predictions of signs to text.
There is not one, but two layers of CNN which improves the accuracy of the model.

We used tkinter for GUI which makes it dynamic in its use and can be used with much lesser hurdles.
